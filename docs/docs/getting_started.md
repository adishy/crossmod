## Installing Crossmod

## Installing Dependencies

* Crossmod is written using Python 3 and has the following dependencies:

* `pandas` (Python Data Analysis Library)
* `praw` (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
* `google-api-client` (Python Google API Client)
* `flask` (Flask Web Framework)
* `sqlalchemy` (Object Relational Mapping interface for database)
* `fasttext` (Python wrapper for fasttext binaries)
* `seaborn` (Used for styling plots)

* Install these dependencies by running the following commands:
  ```
  pip3 install flask
  pip3 install pandas
  pip3 install praw
  pip3 install google-api-python-client
  pip3 install sqlalchemy
  pip3 install fasttext
  pip3 install seaborn
  ```
Note that using a Python virtual environment is highly recommended (but not necessary). A guide to set up a Python virtual environment can be found [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/).
If using a python virtual environment, replace `pip3` with `pip` when installing Crossmod dependencies. 

Getting Credentials for Crossmod

Crossmod currently uses Googleâ€™s Perspective API for moderation tasks. A personal Perspective API Key can be obtained following [these instructions](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/tree/master/1-get-started). After obtaining the API key, paste it into `keys/perspective-api-key.txt`
Obtain Reddit API credentials by creating an app [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and paste the client ID and client secret along with the username and password for the Reddit account used for creating the app as comma separated values on the second line of `keys/crossmod-creds.txt` (no spaces necessary between each comma separated value.

## Set up keys

* Crossmod depends on a few credentials and constants, such as the key for Perspective API, Reddit credentials for `praw`, and the paths to the sqlite database file and the Crossmod fasttext classifiers.

* To set up the keys file for Crossmod, first cp the crossmod_credentials_example.sh to a file called crossmod_credentials.sh
Assuming the Crossmod repository was cloned to the home directory of the user

~~~
    git clone https://github.com/ceshwar/crossmod
    cd crossmod
    cp crossmod_credentials_example.sh crossmod_credentials.sh
~~~

* Open crossmod_credentials.sh and replace the keys with credentials obtained previously. The crossmod_credentials.sh file should also contain the path to the directory containing fasttext models that Crossmod requires for cross-community predictions.

* Edit ~/.profile to load Crossmod credentials into the environment on login
~~~
    echo "source ~/crossmod/crossmod_credentials.sh" >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
~~~

## Starting Crossmod
* Crossmod can be started by running the `crossmod.py` script with the required arguments:
    * The name of the subreddit
    * An indicator to actually perform actions spepcified in config.py [0, 1]
    * An indicator to use Crossmod's backend classifers [0, 1]
~~~
    cd ~/crossmod/code
    # crossmod.py <subreddit-name> <perform-action [0, 1]> <use-classifiers [0, 1]>
    python3 crossmod.py modbot_staging 1 1
